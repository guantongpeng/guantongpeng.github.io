## Anaconda Environment Issues
Check environment information: `conda info -e`  
Create a new environment: `conda create --name environment_name python=3.7`  
Create an environment and add a package: `conda create --name environment_name package_name`  
Remove an environment: `conda remove -n environment_name --all`  
Switch to an environment: `conda activate environment_name`  
Exit an environment: `conda deactivate`  
Export package names in the environment: `conda env export --name environment_name > export_name.yaml`  
Install packages in bulk: `conda install --yes --file base.txt`  
## Conda Package Installation
Install a package: `conda install package_name`  
Update a package: `conda update package_name`  
Update some packages: `conda update numpy scipy pandas`  
Update all packages: `conda update --all`  
Uninstall a package: `conda remove package_name`  
View installed packages: `conda list`  
Upgrade Anaconda: `conda update anaconda`  
## Add Domestic Mirror Source for Conda
```python
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/free
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/main
conda config --set show_channel_urls yes
```
Switch back to default source
```python
conda config --remove-key channels
```
## Pip Package Installation
Install a package: `pip install package_name`  
View packages that need updating: `pip list --outdated`  
Update a package: `pip install -U package_name` or `pip install --upgrade package_name`  
Uninstall a package: `pip uninstall package_name`  
View installed packages: `pip list`  
Export environment: `pip list --format=freeze > requirements.txt`  
Install packages in bulk via requirements file: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
Uninstall software packages in bulk via requirements file: `pip uninstall -r requirements.txt`  
Conda package installation is safer compared to pip, as it automatically resolves package configuration issues, but it is relatively slower.
## Change Pip to Domestic Mirror Source
Temporary use: 
You can add the `-i` parameter after using pip to specify the pip source 
```python
pip install scrapy -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```
Permanent modification: 
Linux: 
Modify `~/.pip/pip.conf` (create one if it doesn't exist), content as follows:
```python
[global]
index-url = https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```
Windows: 
Directly create a pip directory in the user directory, such as: C:\Users\xx\pip, create a new file pip.ini, content as follows
```python
[global]
index-url = https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```
## Change Setup to Domestic Mirror Source
Method One:
Modify the `~/.pydistutils.cfg` file `vim ~/.pydistutils.cfg` to:
```python
[easy_install]
index_url = https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```
Method Two:
Directly place a setup.cfg in the same directory as setup.py:
```python
[easy_install]
index_url = https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```
